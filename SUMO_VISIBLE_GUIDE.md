# üö¶ SUMO Visible Vehicle Movement Guide

## üéØ **CRITICAL: Follow These Steps Exactly**

### **Step 1: SUMO Should Now Be Running**
- Look for the SUMO window on your screen
- It should show the intersection with roads

### **Step 2: Set the Delay (MOST IMPORTANT!)**
1. **Find the "Delay (ms)" field** in the SUMO toolbar
2. **Change it from "0" to "500"** (this makes vehicles move slowly and visibly)
3. **Press Enter** to apply the delay

### **Step 3: Start the Simulation**
1. **Click the PLAY button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)** in the toolbar
2. **Wait for the 5-second mark** - first vehicle will appear
3. **Watch vehicles appear every 5 seconds**

### **Step 4: What You Should See**
- **Colored rectangles** representing vehicles
- **Vehicles moving slowly** along the roads
- **Traffic lights changing** colors
- **Smooth animation** at 500ms delay

## üîß **If You Still Don't See Vehicles:**

### **Option A: Manual Step-by-Step**
1. Set delay to **500ms**
2. Click **STEP** button (‚è≠Ô∏è) repeatedly to advance frame by frame
3. Watch for vehicles at: 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s, 25s, 30s

### **Option B: Try Different Delays**
- Try **200ms** for faster movement
- Try **1000ms** for very slow movement
- Try **100ms** for quick but visible movement

### **Option C: Zoom and Pan**
1. **Mouse wheel** to zoom in/out
2. **Right-click and drag** to pan around
3. **Look for small colored rectangles** on the roads

## üé¨ **Your Video Replication Schedule:**
- **5.0s**: Vehicle 0 (East route) - Red rectangle
- **10.0s**: Vehicle 1 (West route) - Blue rectangle  
- **15.0s**: Vehicle 2 (West route) - Green rectangle
- **20.0s**: Vehicle 3 (North route) - Yellow rectangle
- **25.0s**: Vehicle 4 (South route) - Purple rectangle
- **30.0s**: Vehicle 5 (East route) - Orange rectangle

## ‚úÖ **Success Indicators:**
- You see colored rectangles moving
- Vehicles follow the road paths
- Traffic lights change colors
- Animation is smooth and visible

## üö® **Common Issues:**
1. **"Simulation ended"** - Click "No" to keep the window open
2. **No vehicles visible** - Check delay is set to 500ms
3. **Too fast to see** - Increase delay to 1000ms
4. **Empty screen** - Try zooming in with mouse wheel

## üéØ **The Key: DELAY = 500ms**
This is the most important setting! Without proper delay, the simulation runs too fast to see.
