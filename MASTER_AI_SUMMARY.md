- **Model Training**: Updates Q-network weights
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors learning progress

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Tests trained model on new traffic scenarios
- Calculates efficiency, accuracy, and stability scores
- Generates comprehensive performance reports

### 2. **Training Parameters**
- Start with higher exploration (epsilon = 0.2)
- Use learning rate scheduling
- Train for sufficient episodes (200+)
- Monitor convergence and adjust accordingly

### 3. **Reward Function Design**
- Design rewards that align with your goals
- Balance immediate vs. long-term rewards
- Include penalties for poor performance
- Test different reward structures

- Use experience replay effectively
- Regularize to prevent overfitting

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues
1. **Low Performance**: Increase training episodes, adjust learning rate
2. **Convergence Problems**: Reduce learning rate, increase target update frequency
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch size, clear old experience data
4. **Poor Rewards**: Check reward function, verify state representation
