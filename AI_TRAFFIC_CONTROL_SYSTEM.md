# AI Traffic Control System Documentation

## 🚦 System Overview

This project implements an AI-powered traffic control system that uses reinforcement learning to dynamically manage traffic signals at multiple intersections. The system integrates SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) with custom AI controllers to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **SUMO Simulation Engine**
   - Multi-intersection traffic network
   - Real-time vehicle movement simulation
   - Traffic light control via TraCI API

2. **AI Controller System**
   - Rule-based traffic management
   - Real-time decision making
   - Multi-intersection coordination

3. **Network Infrastructure**
   - Two traffic light intersections (I1, I2)
   - Main road (East-West) and secondary roads (North-South)
   - Multiple vehicle types and traffic flows

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- SUMO (Eclipse SUMO)
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation
1. Install SUMO from https://eclipse.org/sumo/
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install traci sumolib numpy matplotlib
   ```

### Running the System

1. **Generate Network** (if needed):
   ```bash
   python create_simple_network.py
   ```

2. **Test Network**:
   ```bash
   python test_simple_network.py
   ```

3. **Launch AI Control**:
   ```bash
   python launch_ai_simulation.py
   ```

## 🤖 AI Controller Features

### Decision Making
The AI controller uses rule-based logic to make traffic decisions:

- **Phase Management**: Controls traffic light phases (North-South, East-West)
- **Timing Optimization**: Adjusts green light duration based on traffic density
- **Coordination**: Coordinates multiple intersections to prevent conflicts
- **Adaptive Control**: Responds to real-time traffic conditions

### Traffic Metrics
The system tracks and optimizes:
- Vehicle waiting time
- Queue length at intersections
- Traffic throughput
- Average vehicle speed
- Phase switching frequency

### Control Actions
- **Keep Current Phase**: Maintain current traffic light state
- **Switch Phase**: Change to next traffic light phase
- **Extend Green**: Add 5-10 seconds to current green phase
- **Coordinate Intersections**: Synchronize multiple intersections

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics
- Total vehicles in simulation
- Average waiting time per vehicle
- Queue length at each intersection
- Average vehicle speed
- Traffic light phase status

### Performance Reports
The system generates comprehensive reports including:
- Total phase switches per intersection
- Final traffic statistics
- Efficiency improvements over fixed timing

## 🔧 Configuration

### Network Configuration
- **Intersections**: 2 traffic light intersections
- **Roads**: Main East-West road with North-South crossings
- **Vehicle Types**: Cars and trucks with different characteristics
- **Simulation Duration**: 5-10 minutes (configurable)

### AI Parameters
- **Minimum Phase Time**: 10 seconds (prevents rapid switching)
- **Maximum Phase Time**: 60 seconds (prevents excessive delays)
- **Control Interval**: 2 seconds (decision frequency)
- **Coordination Delay**: 5 seconds (intersection synchronization)

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Intersection Control
- Simultaneous control of multiple traffic lights
- Coordinated timing to prevent conflicts
- Independent decision making per intersection

### 2. Real-time Adaptation
- Continuous monitoring of traffic conditions
- Dynamic adjustment of signal timing
- Responsive to traffic density changes

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Minimizes vehicle waiting time
- Reduces traffic congestion
- Improves overall traffic flow efficiency

### 4. Visual Monitoring
- Real-time SUMO GUI visualization
- Live performance metrics display
- Traffic light status monitoring

## 📈 Results and Benefits
