## üîß DASHBOARD INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS

### To Integrate with Your Dashboard:

1. **Import the function**:
   ```python
   from dashboard_start_simulation import start_ai_simulation_from_dashboard
   ```

2. **Call when user clicks "Start Simulation"**:
   ```python
   def on_start_simulation_click():
       success = start_ai_simulation_from_dashboard()
       if success:
           # Show success message
           print("AI simulation started!")
       else:
           # Show error message
           print("Failed to start simulation")
   ```

3. **Check simulation status**:
   ```python
   from dashboard_start_simulation import get_simulation_status
   status = get_simulation_status()
   ```
