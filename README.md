# SIH-Smart-Traffic-Signal-Control-for-Urban-Congestion
This is the project i build with my team for the SIH 2025 on problem statement Smart Traffic Signal Control for Urban Congestion the whole aim of this project was to train our model on SUMO Simulation using Deep RL algo like DQN to optimize the way traffic signals work Hence, Reducing Traffic/ Congestion.
