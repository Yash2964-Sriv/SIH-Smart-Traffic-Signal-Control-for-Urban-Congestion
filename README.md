# SIH-Smart-Traffic-Signal-Control-for-Urban-Congestion
This is the project i build with my team for the SIH 2025 on problem statement Smart Traffic Signal Control for Urban Congestion the whole aim of this project was to train our model on SUMO Simulation using Deep RL algo like DQN to optimize the way traffic signals work Hence, Reducing Traffic/ Congestion.

# 🧠 AI Traffic Control System

## 🎯 **Overview**

This is a complete Deep Q-Network (DQN) AI system for adaptive traffic signal control. The AI learns to optimize traffic light timing in real-time to minimize waiting times, reduce congestion, and improve traffic flow.

### **1. DQN Traffic AI (`dqn_traffic_ai.py`)**

**Features:**
- Deep Q-Network with 3 hidden layers
- Experience replay buffer
- Target network for stable training
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy

**State Space (8 dimensions):**
- `vehicles_north` - Number of vehicles waiting northbound
- `vehicles_south` - Number of vehicles waiting southbound  
- `vehicles_east` - Number of vehicles waiting eastbound
- `vehicles_west` - Number of vehicles waiting westbound
- `current_phase` - Current traffic light phase (0: NS green, 1: EW green)
- `elapsed_time` - Time since last phase change
- `queue_length` - Total queue length
- `avg_speed` - Average vehicle speed

**Action Space (4 actions):**
- `0: extend_green_5s` - Extend current green by 5 seconds
- `1: extend_green_10s` - Extend current green by 10 seconds
- `2: switch_to_ew` - Switch to East-West green
- `3: switch_to_ns` - Switch to North-South green

### **2. SUMO Integration (`sumo_ai_integration.py`)**

**Features:**
- Real-time data extraction from SUMO via TraCI
- Traffic light control
- Performance metrics calculation
- Episode management

**Key Functions:**
- `get_traffic_state()` - Extract current traffic state
- `execute_action()` - Apply AI decision to traffic light
- `calculate_reward()` - Compute reward for AI action

### **3. Training Pipeline (`train_traffic_ai.py`)**

**Features:**
- Automated training with progress tracking
- Model checkpointing
- Performance visualization
- Training logs and metrics

**Training Configuration:**
- Episodes: 200
- Steps per episode: 1000

- Model saving: Every 20 episodes

### **4. Real-time Controller (`real_time_ai_controller.py`)**

**Features:**
- Live traffic control
- Dashboard data generation
- Performance monitoring
- Baseline comparison

## 📊 **Performance Metrics**

### **Primary Metrics:**
- **Average Waiting Time** - Time vehicles spend waiting at intersection
- **Throughput** - Number of vehicles passing per minute
- **Queue Length** - Number of vehicles in queue
- **Total Reward** - AI's cumulative reward

### **Reward Function:**
```python
reward = -waiting_time_penalty + throughput_reward - queue_penalty - switching_penalty + efficiency_bonus
```

## 🎓 **Training Process**

### **1. Data Collection**
- AI observes traffic state from SUMO
- Selects action using epsilon-greedy policy
- Executes action on traffic light
- Receives reward based on performance

### **2. Learning**
- Experience stored in replay buffer
- Neural network trained on random batches
- Target network updated periodically
- Epsilon decayed over time

### **3. Evaluation**
- Performance tracked over episodes
- Plots generated for visualization
- Models saved at checkpoints

## 🚦 **Real-time Control**
